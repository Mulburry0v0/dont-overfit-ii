# dont-overfit-ii
## This is my EE551 individual project. It is a playground prediction competition on Kaggle.
# Proposal:
## This project is a competition that challenges mere mortals to model a 20000*300 matrix of contiuous variables using 250 training samples. The result should be a prediction of the binary target associated with each row, without overfitting to the minimal set of training examples provided.
# Files:
## * train.csv - the training set. 250 rows.
## * test.csv - the test set. 19750 rows.
## * sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
# General Steps:
## * EDA on the features;
## * Try different models: such as linear models, decision tree;
## * Feature selection;
## * Optimize models.

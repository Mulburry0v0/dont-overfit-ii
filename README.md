# dont-overfit-ii
# This is my EE551 individual project. It is a playground prediction competition on Kaggle.
# Proposal:
# This project is a competition that challenged mere mortals to model a 200000*300 matrix of contiuous variables using 250 training samples. The result should be a prediction of the binary target associated with each row, without overfitting to the minimal set of training examples provided.
# Files:
## train.csv
## test.csv
## sample_submission.csv
# General Steps:
## EDA on the features;
## Try different models: such as linear models, decision tree;
## Feature selection;
## Optimize models
